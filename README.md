# V1-Visual-Cortex-Visualization

This repository encodes a stimulus image into a shared latent space of the neural response in the V1 visual cortex of a rhesus macaque monkey. The latent image encoding is decoded into a synthetic waveform, and the natural neural response as well as the synthetic responses are encoded into a latent space to be decoded into the reconstructed image. 

This process details the encoding of images into a representation that is translatable into a set of synthetic neural waveforms that resemble the natural waveform response. These waveforms are the stimulation input into the V1 visual cortex to provide sight to the blind. 

The reconstruction of the original image from the shared latent representation of the encoded neural waveforms is a process that would enable a Neuralinked individual to record what they are currently seeing and extensibly imagining or dreaming. Potential applications of this technology include saving and storing memories, psycho-analysis, & novel means of communication.
