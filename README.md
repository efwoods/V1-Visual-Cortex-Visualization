I am working on a project that will make a prediction of what stimulus image is associated with what neural response. This will then be leveraged to create a generative model that will create images based upon neural input. 

This is the dataset:

Here is the video of generative imagery:

## Objective

- **Prediction**: Train a model to predict the neural response based on pairing of natural movie segments and associated neural responses recorded from the primary visual cortex (V1) of macaque monkeys. In other words, given an image, what is the predicted neural response?

- **Generation**: Use the neural responses to generate new images using the association of the neural responses recorded from the primary visual cortex (V1) of macaque monkeys and the stimulus images as training data. In other words, reverse the previous prediction: given a neural response, generate the image that ellictited the neural response. What is the monkey seeing?
