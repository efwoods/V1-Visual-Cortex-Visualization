I am working on a project that will make a prediction of what stimulus image is associated with what neural response. This will then be leveraged to create a generative model that will create images based upon neural input. 

This is the dataset:

Here is the video of generative imagery:

Please scaffold this product using my preferences as if this were a new project request.
