To estimate how many electrodes are required to simulate a 7200 Ã— 3600 resolution image (â‰ˆ26 million pixels) in the V1 visual cortex, we need to analyze:
ðŸ”¬ Understanding the Biological Constraints
1. V1 Cortical Organization

    The primary visual cortex (V1) has a retinotopic mapâ€”each part corresponds to a location in the visual field.

    The cortical magnification factor (CMF) means:

        Fovea: ~50% of V1 is dedicated to the central 2Â° of vision

        Periphery: Has much coarser resolution

2. V1 Neuron Density

    V1 contains about 140 million neurons per hemisphere (Pakkenberg & Gundersen, 1997).

    Only a fraction of these are directly involved in encoding fine-grained visual info (like receptive fields that represent single pixels).

    Estimated useful channel count for prosthetic stimulation is much lower due to overlap, noise, and constraints on electrode selectivity.

ðŸ§  Conversion from Pixels to Electrodes

Letâ€™s make estimates for electrode requirements for different stimulation goals:
A. Ideal Case: One Electrode per Pixel

    7200 Ã— 3600 = 25,920,000 pixels

    This assumes each electrode can precisely, independently, and reliably stimulate a 1-pixel-sized receptive field.

    This is not realistic in 2025â€”current spatial resolution of invasive electrodes is far lower.

B. Realistic Case: One Electrode per ~100 Pixels

This is consistent with:

    Current high-density Utah arrays or Neuralinkâ€™s N1 probes, which may influence ~10â€“100 nearby neurons per site.

    Neural modeling shows 1:50â€“1:200 electrode-to-neuron selectivity.

So,

    25,920,000100=259,20010025,920,000â€‹=259,200 electrodes required

C. Minimum Viable: Foveated Vision Approximation

Foveal region (~2Â°) = 240 Ã— 240 = 57,600 pixels

    V1 dedicates ~50% of its area to this region

    So, to simulate perceptually sharp, foveated vision, you could prioritize:

        ~50,000â€“100,000 electrodes, densely packed in the foveal cortical representation

This would deliver an experience closer to natural central vision, with peripheral blur.
ðŸ“‰ Technological Feasibility (2025 Reality Check)
Neuralink N1 (2025 estimates):

    Each thread: 32 electrodes

    A module has ~1024 electrodes

    Elon Musk suggested thousands of modules may be implanted in the future (not current reality)

To reach:

    ~100,000 electrodes â†’ Need ~100 modules

    ~250,000 electrodes â†’ Need ~250 modules

This is currently beyond feasible safe surgical limits but may be achievable over the next 10â€“15 years with:

    High-bandwidth wireless stacks

    Advanced cooling/power strategies

    Local cortical compression
